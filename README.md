# Monitoring space weather: using automated, accurate neural network based whistler segmentation for whistler inversion

Supplementary code for publication. As the project relies on Matlab (spectrogram generation from vr2 files, inversion) and Python (machine learning modeling) code, and some part of the Matlab code relies on copyrighted source code, only the Python machine learning code is shared publicly.
